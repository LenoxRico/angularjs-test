# AngularJS Phone Catalog Application

## Overview

Tutorial: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.

## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an AngularJS application.
